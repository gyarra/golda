                  was born in Belgium in 1943 and raised in Oakland, CA. He began 
                  writing poetry in 1965 after discovering Beat poets and writers. 
                  Mr. Clausen writes what could arguably be termed “outsider poetry” 
  with an awareness of social consciousness. He is the author 
  of 9 books of poetry. An international traveler, he has read 
  his poetry in places as diverse as California and Kathmandu. 
  Allen Ginsberg referred to Mr. Clausen as the “Future of American 
                  Poetry.” Mr. Clausen has taught at the Naropa Institute and 
                  worked in the Poetry in the Schools projects in CA, NJ, NY and 
                  CO. He currently teaches creative writing in NYC schools, and 
                  is working on memoirs of his friendships with various Beat poets. 
                  Mr. Clausen’s decisive work is the culmination of 30 years of 
                  his poetry, titled <b><i>40th Century Man<span style="font-weight:

                  in 1935. In the mid-sixties, he was publisher, editor and contributor 
                  to the Tangier based avant-garde magazine, <b><i>GNAOUA</i></b>, 
                  featuring writers such as William Burroughs and Bryan Gysin. In Kathmandu, as 
                  founder of the Starstreams Poetry Series under the Bardo Matrix 
                  imprint in the mid-seventies, Mr. Cohen published Gregory Corso, 
                  Charles Henri Ford and Paul Bowles, among other accomplished 
                  writers. <br>
  <br>
  Mr. Cohen is 
also a noted photographer whose work has been exhibited in galleries 
worldwide—from New York to Tokyo and many places in between. 
                  As a filmmaker, his works include <b><i>The Invasion of the 
                  Thunderbolt</i></b> <b> <i>Pagoda </i></b>(recently released 
                  on DVD), <b><i> Paradise Now</i></b> and <b><i>Kings with Straw 
  Mats</i></b>. <br>
  <br>
Mr. Cohen participated 
                  in the 2006 NYC Whitney Biennial which featured a reading by 
                  Mr. Cohen, an exhibit of his photographs, and a showing of his 
                  cult film <b><i>The Invasion of the Thunderbolt Pagoda </i></b>(first 
                  screened in 1968). His friend Robert Yarra recently assisted 
                  Mr. Cohen in obtaining both an Author’s Guild grant and a PEN 
                  grant. Mr. Cohen has been a resident of NYC since 1980. <br>

                  and Jack Kerouac, Beat poet Gregory Nunzio Corso authored approximately 
                  20 volumes of poetry. His 1961 poetry collection <b><i>Elegiac</i></b><i> 
                  <b> Feelings American</b></i> established Mr. Corso as among 
                  the co-founders of the Beat movement. Mr. Corso was 
                  born in 1930 in NYC. He had a rough and tumble childhood and 
                  youth, ending up incarcerated for three years on a robbery charge. 
                  He spent his days in prison reading classics and memorizing the dictionary. 
                  His poems are infused with his own unique style and subject 
                  matter. Mr. Corso was also a painter whose paintings and drawings 
                  were shown in the 1990s at New York University.<br>
              <br>
  Mr. Corso died 
      in January of 2001. His ashes are buried in his beloved Rome, 
      close to the British poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley, where he wished 
to be laid to rest. Golda Foundation founder, Robert Yarra, arranged for his friend Gregory to be buried in Rome at the exquisite Cimitero Acattolico. <br>

  HIRSCHMAN:</a></font> &nbsp;Mr. Hirschman 
                  is the current poet laureate of San Francisco. He is the author 
                  of 50 volumes of poetry and essays and 25 books of translations 
                  from 8 languages. He published his first book in 1953. A socially 
                  conscious poet, Mr. Hirschman believes it is the artist’s role 
                  to challenge the status quo and fight for social transformation 
                  and political responsibility. He is a champion of the poor and 
                  the marginalized. Upon learning he had been selected as poet 
                  laureate, Mr. Hirschman stated it was an honor for him personally, 
  “and I think a very small victory for the people’s movement, 
                  which has had very few victories recently in this chaotic world.” 
  Jack Hirshman's <strong><em>The Arcanes</em></strong>, a 1000-page collection of many of
				  his poems, was published to great acclaim last year by Multimedia Edizioni.

                  Educated at the University of Cincinnati and Wagner College 
                  in Staten Island, he studied poetry and underground filmmaking

                  He went to work for Andy Warhol in 1963 as a silk screening 
                  assistant and soon become a major influence on the art and films 
                  created in Warhol's Factory. He starred in many Warhol productions, 
                  such as The Chelsea Girls and Vinyl, and introduced Warhol to 
                  many of his most noteworthy collaborators, among them artist/filmmaker 
                  Paul Morrissey, the band, The Velvet Underground, and Warhol 
                  Superstars Nico and International Velvet. <br>
                  <br>

Together Warhol and Malanga founded

  MYERS:</a></font> Ms. Myers was born 
                  in Australia in 1930. She was the lead dancer in the Melbourne 
                  Modern Ballet Company before leaving Australia to live in Europe. 
                  Ms. Myers moved to Post WWII Paris, where she lived on the streets 
                  of Saint Germain des Pres. While in Paris she met Tennessee Williams, 
                  Salvador Dali, Jean Cocteau and Jean Genet. She eventually left for Italy, where she found a “paradise” 
  in a verdant valley near Positano. Ms. Myers drew
  colorful and intricate drawings using pen-and-ink, each one taking from 6 months 
                  to 2 years to complete. She decorated her face and body with 
                  similarly intricately detailed tattoos.  Ms. Myers spent time in New York City where she held a salon in her room at the Chelsea Hotel.
                  There have been five movies made of the life of Vali Myers. A book of her drawings and journals from 1980 to the present is in the works.<br>
                  <br>
Ms. Myers returned to Australia in 1992 and kept a studio 
                  in Melbourne. She passed away after a short illness in February 
                  2003.

                  was born in 1932. He graduated from Columbia University in NYC. 
                  He was a scholar known for his extensive knowledge of classical 
                  music. With his wife, Irvyne Richard he owned and ran “The 
                  Rare Book Room” in Greenwich Village, NYC. Mr. Richard was 
                  a patron and supporter of Gregory Corso, who lived with the 
                  Richards’ for 12 years. “The Rare Book Room” was a beloved and 
                  much-frequented hangout for writers, bohemians, and some street 
                  folks whom Mr. Richard welcomed and assisted. <br>
                  <br>
                  His kindness 
and financial support for creative down-and-outers eventually 
cost him his business. As Robert Yarra stated, “it was hard 
                  for Roger to run a business and a salon at the same time, especially as many of his friends at the bookstore were in an advanced state of inebriation.”&nbsp; 
  Mr. Richard passed away on his birthday in December 2002 and is much missed among 
  writers and others in the Village. <br>

We became friends around that time  during a chance meeting in Greenwich Village, and we  have remained friends since then.      Swami was born in Philadelphia and grew up on the  streets there.
