                      THE RABBI'S BASEMENT TAPES</p>
                    <p class="style59">&ldquo;My grandfather is stirring,&rdquo; Lionel Ziprin says,  worried.&nbsp; His grandfather died in  1955.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s buried in Israel.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s making him restless over there?&nbsp; Maybe the sudden fame of his old friend, the  late Harry Smith.&nbsp; Smith&rsquo;s landmark  Anthology of American Folk Music, originally released as six LPs in 1952, was  reissued on CD this past August to universal acclaim.&nbsp; Articles everywhere, a whole book (Greil Marcus&rsquo; Invisible  Republic) positioning it as the inspiration for Dylan and everything that  happens in American pop music after him.</p>
                    <p class="style59">Ziprin&rsquo;s grandfather must be wondering whatever happened to  the records he made with Harry Smith.&nbsp;  No fewer than 15 LP&rsquo;s and untold hours more on tape, of nothing more  than Ziprin&rsquo;s granddad, recorded in his bedroom on the Lower East Side, singing  and telling stories.</p>
                    <p class="style59">Ziprin lives on E. Broadway, way over on the Lowest East  Side, where he was born.&nbsp; Now more  Chinese and Latino than the de facto Jewish ghetto was when he grew up.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style59">(There&rsquo;s&nbsp; a big  Iglesia Christiana Primitiva right cross the street, just like a jest of  history.)&nbsp; A small man affecting a  rabbi&rsquo;s white beard and dark clothes, his hair tucked up in a variety of hats  (today it&rsquo;s a NASA cap), chain-smoking Tareyton 100s, pacing a living room  crowded with old bits of furniture, books, a couple of chests filled with old  papers.&nbsp; His speech has the pure  corned-beef cadences of the old Jewish LES.&nbsp;  As I&rsquo;ve written before, Ziprin&rsquo;s one of the undersung linchpins of New  York hipster history.&nbsp; Beatniks,  hippies, jazzmen, poets, painters, rockers, mystics, magicians and the slumming  zillionaires who support them all &mdash; everybody knows Lionel.<br>
</p>
<p class="style59">Poet, Scholar (born some time in the 1920s) Domicile: New  York
  City</p>
<p class="style59">Lionel personifies the old-fashioned Lower East Side where  he was born and
  raised by his grandmother and grandfather, an eminent rabbi.  He grew up
  endowed with an ability to see into alternative realms.&nbsp; After WWII his
  literary career looked promising. Ezra Pound read one of his  poems in a<br>
  magazine and initiated a correspondence. Lionel married and  had children.
  For years he took care of his mother, Sheba, until her  passing. Lionel is
  very devout. He is currently completing a book to go with  recordings (made
  by Harry Smith) of his grandfather singing; songs which  would otherwise be
  lost forever.</p>

    March 20, 2009 <br>
    <br>
    <a href="lionelziprin.html">LIONEL ZIPRIN </a>, Mystic of the Lower East Side, Dies at  84  </p>
  <span class="style59">&ldquo;We  are not after all intended to be consumed.&rdquo;   So  begins Lionel Ziprin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sentential Metaphrastic,&rdquo; a &ldquo;poem in progress&rdquo; of more  than a thousand pages.    So  begins Lionel Ziprin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sentential Metaphrastic,&rdquo; a &ldquo;poem in progress&rdquo; of more  than a thousand pages. &ldquo;I reduced it to 785 pages,&rdquo; Mr. Ziprin told The Jewish  Quarterly in 2006. &ldquo;I call it the longest and most boring poem since Milton&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Paradise Lost.&rsquo;&nbsp;<br>  
    <br>
&rdquo;Many  more poems by Mr. Ziprin remain to be discovered, inscribed on spiral-bound  notebooks and stuffed into a closet in his apartment on the Lower East Side of  Manhattan. And that is nowhere near the half of it. Also in the apartment are  the Jewish liturgical chants intoned by Mr. Ziprin&rsquo;s grandfather, untold hours  of sacred music that Mr. Ziprin tried for more than half a century to bring to  the wider world.<br>
  <br>
  This  legacy now passes to his family &mdash; whether to delight or puzzle posterity, no  one knows. Mr. Ziprin, a brilliant, baffling, beguiling voice of the Lower East  Side and the East Village in all its phases &mdash; Jewish, hipster and hippie &mdash; died  last Sunday in Manhattan. He was 84. The cause was chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease, his daughter Zia Ziprin said.<br>
  <br>
  For  decades, Mr. Ziprin, a self-created planet, exerted a powerful gravitational  attraction for poets, artists, experimental filmmakers, would-be philosophers  and spiritual seekers. <br>
  <br>
  He  ran his apartment, on Seventh Street in the East Village, as a bohemian salon,  attracting a loose collective that included the ethnomusicologist Harry Smith,  the photographer Robert Frank and the jazz musician <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/thelonious_monk/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Thelonious Monk."><span style="color:#004276;">Thelonious Monk</span></a>, who would drop by  for meals between sets at the Five Spot. <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/bob_dylan/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Bob Dylan."><span style="color:#004276;">Bob Dylan</span></a> paid the occasional  visit.<br>
  <br>
  There  the art of conversation took a backseat to the art of listening to Mr. Ziprin  hold forth for hours at a stretch on magic, interplanetary rhythms, angels,  apparitions and Jewish history.<br>
  <br>
&ldquo;He  was larger than life and so far beyond a certain kind of description that I am  bamboozled,&rdquo; said Ira Cohen, a longtime friend. &ldquo;He was much larger than a  poet, though that&rsquo;s hard for me to say, as a poet. He was one of the big secret  heroes of the time.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  Often  categorized as a beatnik, he created an artistic circle that overlapped with  the worlds of jazz and beat poetry but remained distinct and apart. A poet prey  to visions and hallucinations, a philosopher, a Jewish mystic with a deep  understanding of the kabbalah, an enthusiastic consumer of amphetamines (legal  at the time) and peyote (also legal) &mdash; he was all of these, and something else  besides. <br>
  <br>
&ldquo;He  combined Old World mysticism and New World craziness,&rdquo; said the poet Janine  Vega. &ldquo;He really was one of the great white magicians of the era.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
  Mr.  Ziprin was born on the Lower East Side and, after his parents separated when he  was a small child, lived with his mother and her parents. The decisive  influence on his life was his maternal grandfather, the rabbi Naftali Zvi  Margolies Abulafia, an immigrant from Galilee who founded the Home of the Sages  of Israel, a yeshiva on the Lower East Side. <br>
  <br>
  The  home atmosphere was devout. <br>
  <br>
&ldquo;I  thought I was living in the Bible,&rdquo; Mr. Ziprin said in a <a href="http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/ot/ot060922rabbi_abulafias_boxe" title="documentary"><span style="color:#004276;">documentary</span></a> produced by Jon Kalish for public radio in 2006. &ldquo; My  grandparents were like biblical people. The only problem I had as a child, I  looked outside, and there were automobiles. There&rsquo;s a big contradiction.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  While  undergoing a tonsillectomy, young Lionel &mdash; called Leibel or Leibele by his  family &mdash; was badly overanesthetized. After emerging from a 10-day coma he  developed St. Vitus&rsquo;s Dance and epilepsy. He was seized by fits of  uncontrollable laughter and experienced hallucinations. For the rest of his  life, he saw visions and conversed with the spirit world.<br>
  <br>
  Physically  unfit for military duty, Mr. Ziprin began writing poetry after attending <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/brooklyn_college/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Brooklyn College"><span style="color:#004276;">Brooklyn College</span></a> and worked at an  assortment of extremely odd jobs. He helped create a short-lived puppet show  called &ldquo;Kabbalah the Cook&rdquo; for television. For $10 apiece, he wrote the text  for a series of war comic books published by Dell.<br>
  <br>
  In  1950 he married Joanna Eashe, a dancer who made a living as a hand and foot  model. In the early 1950s the couple started a totally unsuccessful greeting  card company, Ink Weed Arts. She died in 1994.In  addition to his daughter Zia, of Manhattan, he is survived by a brother,  Jordan, of Phoenix; another daughter, Dana Ziprin of Richmond, Calif.; two  sons, Leigh and Noah, both of Berkeley, Calif; and three grandchildren. 
  </p>
  </span>  </span>
  <ul><li class="style59">Mr.  Ziprin&rsquo;s poems, including &ldquo;Math Glass&rdquo; and &ldquo;What This Abacus Was,&rdquo; appeared  here and there in magazines like Zero, but he barely bothered to pursue a  career. A poet in the prophetic tradition, he did not so much write as open  himself up to otherworldly voices. </li>
    <li class="style59">&ldquo;He  would read the stuff we published and would have no idea that he&rsquo;d written it,&rdquo;  said Judy Upjohn, who, with Sandy Rower, published a selection of Mr. Ziprin&rsquo;s  verse in &ldquo;Almost All Lies Are Pocket Size&rdquo; (Flockaphobic Press, 1990).</li>
    <li class="style59">Clayton  Patterson, who is writing a history of the Lower East Side, filmed Mr. Ziprin  reading his &ldquo;Book of Logic &rdquo; and organized a screening of 10 two-hour  installments at Anthology Film Archives in 1989. &ldquo;The first night there was a  full house,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By the third night there were three people, besides  Lionel and myself. That ended the series.&rdquo;</li>
    <li class="style59">Mr.  Smith, the ethnomusicologist who produced the seminal Anthology of American  Folk Music for Folkways Records, heard Mr. Ziprin&rsquo;s grandfather chanting at a  public celebration and became obsessed. Setting up sound equipment in the  rabbi&rsquo;s yeshiva, he spent two years recording hundreds of hours of Hebrew  liturgical chants, along with Arabic songs and Yiddish stories, which were  distilled into 15 long-playing records. </li>
    <li class="style59">Shortly  before his death in 1955, the rabbi begged his grandson to bring the records to  a wider audience, inspiring a half-century quest whose end remains uncertain.  Folkways released one album from the set, but for religious reasons, family  members objected to further distribution of the material. </li>
    <li class="style59">In  the late 1960s Mr. Ziprin&rsquo;s wife took the children and moved to Berkeley,  Calif., plunging Mr. Ziprin into a spiritual crisis. It was resolved when,  acting on instructions from his grandfather in a dream, he returned to the Judaism  of his youth and to the Lower East Side, moving into his mother&rsquo;s apartment on  East Broadway to care for her until her death in the late 1980s.</li>
    <li class="style59">From  the mid-1970s until his death, Mr. Ziprin spent his days studying the Torah and  other texts at what was once his grandfather&rsquo;s yeshiva. He held court at his  apartment. He scribbled thoughts on postcards and sent them to just about  anyone. </li>
    <li class="style59">He  also searched for someone willing to produce his grandfather&rsquo;s records. As the  years went on, and some of the tapes were lost to fire, flood and theft, the  mercurial and often cantankerous Mr. Ziprin often seemed to be sabotaging his  own cause, eager to disseminate his grandfather&rsquo;s legacy but reluctant to let  it go. </li>
    <li class="style59">Briefly  it looked as if the composer <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/john_zorn/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about John Zorn."><span style="color:#004276;">John Zorn</span></a> had secured the rights  to release the records, but Mr. Ziprin could not let go. At his death, the  Idelsohn Society for Musical Preservation had made a compilation CD from the  material that seemed to please Mr. Ziprin, clearing the way for the production  of a full boxed set.</li>
    <li class="style59">A  man of many words, he managed to write his self-portrait in just a few: </li>
    <li class="style59">I  have never been arrested. I</li>
    <li class="style59">have  never been institutionalized.</li>
    <li class="style59">I  have four children. I am in</li>
