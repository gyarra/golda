    <br>
    "Urgent plea to 
    help artist extraordinaire Ira Cohen survive a bedbug   infestation."<BR>
    <BR>
    Ira is up   against it. Please do what you can.<BR>
    <BR>
    All the best,<BR>
    Bobby   Yarra<BR>
    <BR>
    Dear All, some maybe new to this info &amp; others may be   tired by it. I need your <BR>
  help that is why I am writing.<br>
  <BR>
    Since last week   the story has gotten all more complicated...If you have any <BR>
    positive   proactive aid please contact me directly 917.539.7965. Please refrain <BR>
    from   skepticism and criticism. There is no time for that   here.<BR>
    <BR>
    UPDATE:<BR>
    for those that need more info about Ira:   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Cohen">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Cohen</a><BR>
    <BR>
    Ira COHEN was holed up in a UWS   tiny hotel since tuesday the 20th ($1200 a week <BR>
    and thats cheap NYC) while   most of his creme de la creme archives were removed <BR>
    from his apt premises   for the exorbitant cost of $10,000 to insure the Corporate 
    <BR>
    landlord that   his apartment would be properly fumigated this past monday 26th <BR>
    (btw which   happened but didn't wholly work!!!!) against bedbugs... Ira's landlord 
    <BR>
    is holding Ira solely responsible for the whole building, should they   move <BR>
    anywhere else anytime soon.<BR>
    <BR>
    By now we should all know the vermin   are rampant in urban centers across the <BR>
    U.S.&nbsp; ("...nearly 11,000 calls about   bedbugs were made to new york city's 311 <BR>
    help line, compared with 537 in the   fiscal year 2004. The number of confirmed <BR>
    infestations has also risen   sharply, to 4,084 last year from 82 six years ago.") <BR>
    <BR>
    I picked Ira up   yesterday on the 27th for what I thought was a victorious day of 
    <BR>
    returning him to his home after the fumigation. We paid a cleaning crew   $300 to <BR>
    come in and clean up all the fumigation dust, Raphael was right   beside them all <BR>
    cleaning for 4 hours breathing in the toxicity. I brought   Ira into the apt at <BR>
    4:30pm after spending the day with nowhere to be( in a   movie theater then a <BR>
    cafe). I went out shortly after we arrived to buy new   sheets, new towels and the 
    <BR>
    like. When I returned,&nbsp; Ira was sitting in   the chair he always sits in, he was <BR>
    talking on the phone to a friend and I   saw 2 bedbugs climbing on that chair I <BR>
    had to immediately remove Ira from   the premises with a distraught Raphael and <BR>
    his aged aid besides, we sat in   the lobby for 3 hours trying to figure out where 
    <BR>
    to take Ira. No one had   offered anything anywhere, we had a crisis. All hotels <BR>
    were booked. We had   no $ because thousands are already spent. Absurdly I had <BR>
    already bought Ira&nbsp;   a new $800 couch which couldn't be delivered. Raphael and I <BR>
    both live in 5   floor walkups with no AC, these were inconceivable options, not <BR>
    one friend   in all of this was around to say "bring him to my house." So at <BR>
    8:30pm last   night we found a different hotel this time at $250 a night for 2 <BR>
    nights on   the UWS so his nurse aid has a place to spend the night with him and <BR>
    give   him proper care(insulin et al).&nbsp; We now have to call the prep crews back in 
    <BR>
    to at the landlord's newest demands to pull up the carpet and now throw   all of <BR>
    the furniture(including the antiques away and cart off the remaining   framed to <BR>
    be unframed artworks to storage). Our new cost for all of this is   somewhere <BR>
    around $20,000.&nbsp; You can retort all this safely from behind your   computers but <BR>
    the only way Ira will be able to maintain his tenant status   with the landlord is 
    <BR>
    by complying with these options. <BR>
    <BR>
    You can   rise up and think of positive ways to raise money for Ira. We have his <BR>
    films   available for showing at gatherings/benefits&nbsp; as people keep suggesting to 
    <BR>
    me but I do not have the time on top of all of this to plan a benefit in   2 days. <BR>
    <BR>
    Wish I was superwoman.Can you help? Do you know off any agencies   to apply for <BR>
    immediate grants? Any generous friends who may be appeased with   a signed <BR>
    photograph for a grand donation?<br>
    <BR>
    HE CANNOT AFFORD ALL THIS. HE   HANDLES IT WELL BECAUSE HE TRUSTS THAT WE ARE 
    TRYING TO HELP HIM. THERE ARE   NO LAWYERS TO FIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
    2-3 DAYS IN WHICH THIS MUST   ALL HAPPEN.WE NEED SOMEWHERE FOR IRA TO STAY FROM 
    TOMORROW MORNING   11AM.????????? <br>
    <br>
    This is our critical mass - ????? if we cannot 
    pay. The end   of Ira at home at 106th street which will surely be the end of IRA 
    COHEN.   His son is distraught and broke, his sister has a husband who is invalid 
    from a stroke and is doing her best to care for Ira in between, not one   friend <BR>
    visited him last week in that previous hotel. <BR>
    <BR>
    I have only   raised $6500 and the most generous donations of $1000 came from one <BR>
    of Ira's   newest friends in the UK, a poets in need grant of $3500 raised by M.R. 
    <BR>
    and by MY friends who don't even have a connection to IRA. I do not   overlook <BR>
    those friends of Ira who have nothing and even sent in $10-$50 ---   you know who <BR>
    you are. The rest simply turn a blind eye saying its always   something with Ira <BR>
    or I have my own problems.&nbsp; I sent out my fundraiser   email to 1200 people I am <BR>
    appalled by the ego-ic community of artists. <BR>
    <BR>
    PLEASE help, any amount of donation is appreciated. We need help to make   sure we 
    <BR>
    can pay this and make sure Ira can return to his home in peace   and his archives <BR>
    are treated and returned in good condition.&nbsp; Please help if   you will. No act of <BR>
    kindness or generosity is overlooked. <br>
    <BR>
    Please pass   this on through your networks to generous souls who appreciate what <BR>
    Ira   stood for his whole life, ENLIGHTENED CULTURE!!!!<BR>
    <BR>
    There is a great quote   by a great poet I share with you all: "Generosity is not <BR>
    giving me that   which I need more than you do, but it is giving me that which you <BR>
    need   more than I do."    Author: Kahlil Gibran <BR>
    <BR>
    I may also post some   artworks/services for auction on this site if anyone cannot 
    <BR>
    give money.   I will accept such offers on the behalf of IRA.There is no end til <BR>
    we reach   our goal. Please send images details and reserve amount to my email <BR>
    below. 
    <BR>
    <BR>
    if you want to pay by credit card, I suggest paypal choose   "personal" and they <BR>
    do not take a percentage: <a href="mailto:artegiano@earthlink.net">artegiano@earthlink.net</a> to   send a check by snail <BR>
    mail:&nbsp; <BR>
    <BR>
    The check should be made out to JANICE   HONIG, Ira's sister who is handling a <BR>
    bank acct for him. You can send it   direct to her as well:&nbsp; Janice Honig, 45 East <BR>
    89th Street #22e NY, NY 10128, (212) 9873806&nbsp; or to me: Ondi McMaster, 52 Bank <BR>
    Street #5,&nbsp; NYC, NY 10014&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ira can be reached by phone but we ask since he is <BR>
    anxious and disturbed by   all this to speak softly on the subject, tickle him <BR>
    don't taunt him.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Please   email me at <a href="mailto:omfineart@gmail.com">omfineart@gmail.com</a> for more info on how to 
  reach him   directly.</span><br>
